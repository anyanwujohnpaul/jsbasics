// Logical Operators

// The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true.

console.log(true && false);
// → false
console.log(true && true);
// → true

// The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true.

console.log(false || true);
// → true
console.log(false || false);
// → false

// Not is written as an exclamation mark (!). It is a unary operator that flips the value given to it—!true produces false and !false gives
// true.

console.log(!true);
// ➡️ false

console.log(!false);
// ➡️ True

//  || has the lowest precedence, then comes &&, then the comparison operators (>, ==, and so on), and then the rest.

// Ternary Operator
// Ternary Operator operates on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like this:

console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
// → 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);
// → 2

// Empty Values

// null and undefined, that are used to denote the absence of a meaningful value. They are themselves values, but they carry no information.

// Automatic Type Conversion

console.log(8 * null);
// → 0
console.log("5" - 1);
// → 4
console.log("5" + 1);
// → 51
console.log("five" * 2);
// → NaN
console.log(false == 0);
// → true

console.log(null == undefined);
// → true
console.log(null == 0);
// → false

// The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean values state that 0, NaN, and the empty string ("") count as false, while all the other values count as true
// We looked at four types of JavaScript values in this chapter: numbers, strings, Booleans, and undefined values. Such values are created by typing in their name (true, null) or value (13, "abc").

// Expression and Statements

// A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.

// Bindings or Variable

let caught = 5 * 5;
console.log(caught);

let ten = 10;
console.log(ten * ten);

let mood = "light";
console.log(mood);
// → light
mood = "dark";
console.log(mood);
// → dark

let luigisDebt = 140;
luigisDebt = luigisDebt - 35;
console.log(luigisDebt);
// → 105

let empty;
console.log(empty);
// This returns undefined because the variable wasn't given a value.

// Variable Naming Convention
// Binding names can be any sequence of one or more letters. Digits can be
// part of binding names—catch22 is a valid name, for example—but the
// name must not start with a digit. A binding name may include dollar signs
// ($) or underscores (_) but no other punctuation or special characters.

// Functions

// A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value. Such values can be applied in order to run the wrapped program.

// prompt("Enter your password");

let max = Math.max(2, 4);
console.log(max);
// → 4

let min = Math.min(2, 100) + 500;
console.log(min);

// Control Flow

// let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
// if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
//   console.log("Your number is the square root of " + theNumber * theNumber);
// } else {
//   console.log("Hey. Why didn't you give me a number?");
// }

// let num = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
// if (num < 10) {
//   console.log("Small");
// } else if (num < 100) {
//   console.log("Medium");
// } else {
//   console.log("Large");
// }

// While and Do Loops
// A statement starting with the keyword while creates a loop. The word
// while is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement,
// much like if. The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the
// expression produces a value that gives true when converted to Boolean.

let number = 0;
while (number <= 12) {
  console.log(number);
  number = number + 2;
}

// Tell ChatGPT to explain this code to you
let result = 1;
let counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
  result = result * 2;
  counter = counter + 1;
}
console.log(result);

// Do Loop
// A do loop is a control structure similar to a while loop. It differs only on
// one point: a do loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts
// testing whether it should stop only after that first execution.

// Tell ChatGPT to explain this step by step
// let yourName;
// do {
//   yourName = prompt("Who are you?");
// } while (!yourName);
// console.log("Hello " + yourName);

// For Loops

for (let number = 0; number <= 12; number += 2) {
  console.log(number);
}
// This code create a for loop; which start by declaring and initialising a variable followed by a condition that needs to be true then
// the variable will be increased by 2 only if the condition is true, the condition being that number (the declared variable) must be
// less than or equal to 12

// Exercise
// Generate a list of odd number between 1 to 20
for (let odd = 1; odd <= 20; odd += 2) {
  console.log(odd);
}

// Generating set of even number between 2 to 30
for (let even = 2; even <= 30; even += 2) {
  console.log(even);
}

for (let oddNo = 1; oddNo <= 30; oddNo += 2) {
  console.log(oddNo);
}

// Using for Loop for to get the result of 2 raised to the power of 10
// Tell ChatGPT to explain what this code does step by step
let resultExponent = 1;
for (let counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
  resultExponent *= 2;
}
console.log(resultExponent);

// Breaking Out of a Loop
// Having the looping condition produce false is not the only way a loop can finish. The break statement has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.

// The code below; finds the first number that is both greater than or equal to 20 and divisible by 7:
for (let current = 20; ; current = current + 1) {
  if (current % 7 == 0) {
    console.log(current);
    break;
  }
}

// Using the remainder (%) operator is an easy way to test whether a number is divisible by another number. If it is, the remainder of their division is zero.

// The for construct in the example does not have a part that checks for the
// end of the loop. This means that the loop will never stop unless the break
// statement inside is executed.

// If you were to remove that break statement or you accidentally write an
// end condition that always produces true, your program would get stuck
// in an infinite loop. A program stuck in an infinite loop will never finish
// running, which is usually a bad thing.

// The continue keyword is similar to break in that it influences the
// progress of a loop. When continue is encountered in a loop body,
// control jumps out of the body and continues with the loop’s next iteration.

// Switch Operator

// switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
//   case "rainy":
//     console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
//     break;
//   case "sunny":
//     console.log("Dress lightly.");
//   case "cloudy":
//     console.log("Go outside.");
//     break;
//   default:
//     console.log("Unknown weather type!");
//     break;
// }

// Capitalization

// Binding names may not contain spaces, yet it is often helpful to use
// multiple words to clearly describe what the binding represents. These are
// pretty much your choices for writing a binding name with several words in
// it:



// Naming Convention in JS
// fuzzylittleturtle;
// fuzzy_little_turtle;
// FuzzyLittleTurtle;
// fuzzyLittleTurtle;

// Comments

// A comment is a piece of text that is part of a program but is completely
// ignored by the computer. JavaScript has two ways of writing comments. To
// write a single-line comment, you can use two slash characters (//) and
// then the comment text after it:


// Quote

// Functions

/*

Functions are one of the most central tools in JavaScript programming. The
concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives
us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate
names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.

*/


// Defining a Function

/*
A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a
function.
*/

// For example, this code defines cube to refer to a function that produces the cube of a given number:

function cube (x) {
  return x * x * x;
}

console.log(cube(3));

/*
A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword
function. Functions have a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and
a body, which contains the statements that are to be executed when the
function is called. The body of a function created this way must always be
wrapped in braces, even when it consists of only a single statement.
*/

// Note: A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined. 


/*

Parameters to a function behave like regular bindings, but their initial
values are given by the caller of the function, not the code in the function
itself.
